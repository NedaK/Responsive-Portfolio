            <p> Hi! My name is Neda Wo, and this is my portfolio.
                <br/>
                I have a BS degree from UC Davis in Biochemistry and Molecular and Cellular Biology.  I worked in a lab for a few years after 
                graduating from college, and then went on to get my Chemistry and Biology teaching credentials.
                I taught high school Chemistry for a few years, but decided to stay home with my kids once they were born.

                <br/>
                I am now looking to get back into the work force.  I have dabbled in programming and web development for the past several years, 
                but am excited to have a program to focus on!
                <br/>
                In my free time I love anything to do with water....swimmings, scuba diving, paddle boarding, surfing, etc.  I love the outdoors, 
                and spending time with my family.
                <br/>
